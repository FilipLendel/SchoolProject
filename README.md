# Projects witch I created for school exams

## A few folders containing sample tasks I had to perform

### Description
Here you will find my basics in programming, the first websites that were created using HTML, CSS and JS.

Created to show syntax, and working with CSS.

The biggest challenge was simplicity, because I didn't understand why we create such basic things, I always wanted to do something more creative and here it shows why you should first understand the basics, simplify what you can, and then take on something serious 

#### Instruction
- Download the folder of your choice
- Open it in any code editor
-  Open the file with the HTML extension in your browser
